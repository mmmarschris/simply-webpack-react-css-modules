# Simply Webpack + React + CSS Modules

Just a little somethin-somethin to get ya in the boilerplate mood.

### Features

- [Webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack)
- [React](https://github.com/facebook/react)
- [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules)
- [Browsersync](https://github.com/BrowserSync/browser-sync)
- [Susy](https://github.com/oddbird/susy) (Unutilized)

### Discoveries

Vanilla CSS Modules is great. But if I am going to use React in a project, I would go with something like [react-css-modules](https://github.com/gajus/react-css-modules) as opposed to the "Webpack CSS loader + CSS Modules" route featured in this repo.


### Install

`$ npm install`

### Run

`$ npm start`

### @TODO

- Switch to React CSS Modules
- Integrate Susy
